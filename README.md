# World Econnomic Growth Forecast

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), since its inception, has played a pivotal role in stabilizing the international landscape of finance and economics. Its comprehensive databases and analytical prowess have been instrumental in aiding member countries to navigate through economic fluctuations and policy-making processes. In the contemporary globalized economy, the IMF's insights are more valuable than ever, providing a wealth of information that can be leveraged to predict future economic trends and potential market shifts.

Building on this foundation, our project aims to harness the vast repository of financial data curated by the IMF to develop robust models for forecasting Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth across various economies. By employing advanced machine learning techniques and deep learning algorithms, we intend to analyze patterns within the data that could indicate future economic outcomes. This predictive model could serve as a crucial tool for economists, policymakers, and investors alike, offering a glimpse into the economic trajectory of nations in the ever-evolving financial landscape.
